Performance tests are designed to catch performance regressions before they reach our
end users. At this time, there is no unified approach for these types of tests,
but `mozperftest </testing/perfdocs/mozperftest.html>`_ aims to provide this in the future.

For more detailed information about each test suite and project, see their documentation:

Critical Performance Tests
--------------------------

Some of our performance tests are marked as critical tests. These are ones where we do not want to regress their metric under any circumstances unless the regression is explicitly approved by appropriate parties. When one of these tests regress, the regressor patch is backed out immediately by sheriffs after it has been found and confirmed.

The following list contains all of our existing critical tests:

    * `Speedometer 3 on Windows 11 <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perfherder/graphs?highlightAlerts=1&highlightChangelogData=1&highlightCommonAlerts=0&replicates=0&series=autoland,5257591,1,13&timerange=2592000>`_
    * `NewsSite Applink Startup on Android A55 <https://treeherder.mozilla.org/perfherder/graphs?highlightAlerts=1&highlightChangelogData=1&highlightCommonAlerts=0&replicates=0&series=autoland,5310509,1,15&timerange=2592000>`_
